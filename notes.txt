technical/data
This dataset is about 30 months out of date, getting an updated dataset would provide larger sample pool
Scripts could be placed into a more accessible python package
code could be optimized for speed / memory footprint.

The performance of loans in 2007-2009 is likely highly informative to the performance of this asset class at the end of a credit cycle, and could likely be very useful for approximating the default behavior of . Perhaps when assesing an appropriate risk position a further investigation of this period, despite the low volume of originations could be useful.
