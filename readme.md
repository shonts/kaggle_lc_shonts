# RUNNING SCRIPTS

you will need to place a loan file called loan.csv in the root directory.

load.py will load this csv and add the columns relevant for the analysis.

analyse.py will perform some basic aggregations and create a few plots using matplotlib.

model.py will create a model of returns based on certain selected origination characteristics, and attempt to validate the results using a testing set of loans.
